# YouTube-Discord-Fetch-
Project for CNT 4104 (Software Proj Comp Networks)
We will be creating a Discord bot that takes YouTube song titles and converts them to YouTube links and/or mp3 and mp4 files. Using the basic YouTube search format, “https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=search_terms”, we will be able to search YouTube using the song title entered by the user. This Discord bot will be used for streaming purposes and file conversion. What can also be added is the different formats that a bot can be linked to as Discord has different methods in which bots execute messages, ranging from embedded to icons that can be interacted with. 

The main language we will be initially implementing is Python. We will be using PyTube to import Youtube links. Using the PyTube Library we can filter the results to show the highest resolution and the user can choose a video or audio file. The questions we had were how it would be involved with networking, what will be the starting process to build said bot, and how will it be able to connect and obtain data on major platforms such as YouTube.
